author: [ { name: "Josef Fruehwald", url: "https://jofrhwld.github.io" }]
abstract: "<p>My dissertation investigated how phonetic and phonological factors influence language change in progress.</p>
<p>So far, my research in this area has mostly utilized data from the Philadelphia Neighborhood Corpus.
On the basis of my investigation of the data it appears that categorical (phonological) factors  play a crucial role in sound changes much earlier than it is sometimes realized.</p>"
